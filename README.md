## Description

This project allows muscians of all kinds to connect with one another and share their sound clips/tracks. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our general knowledge of full-stack web development.

The project allows the user to create their own profile, upload their own music tracks, and share their music tracks with other musicians. The user can connect with other users, the potential connection are displayed in swipable cards, the cards display the other user's info and a playable music track. If the user chooses to match with the user, they may swipe right, doing so will add the mtached user to a 'favorites' array, which the user can view and see who they have matched with previously. They can also choose to not match with the displayed user, they must swipe left, doing so will add the rejected potential match to a 'nopes' array. The 'nopes' array keeps track of the rejected matches, it is not displayed. The user may also update their profile and change their basic user info, as well as overwrite the initially uploaded sound file in their profile. 

The project focuses on the MERN stack. MongoDB for the data storage, Express, for the backend, React for the front end, and Node.js to set up the server. This project also incorporates GraphQL to help specify user requests to the back end. 

Cloudinary was used in order to upload user created music tracks to their profiles. Cloudinary is an uploading tool the allows user to upload a number of different file types to a web app.

We also used a package that gave us the ability to create a swipable card. The swipe functionality lends itself to a more fluid experience, especially for the mobile user.
